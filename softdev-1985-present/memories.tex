\section{Introduction}

I have been involved in software development for many years now. This does not mean I possess any great insight or wisdom regarding the industry however. I'd like to think I have a tiny bit, but that is probably simply false. I have worked in several industries and experienced many different technologies along the way. This is an experiment that serves several selfish purposes. First, I would like to document the evolution of my thoughts and feelings regarding the creation of software. Second, ....

\section{Apple ][c - The early days}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item TI 994A - Tunnels of doom
	\item 6502 ASM
	\item Apple ][ assembler tools
	\item floppy based account management written in asm with PRODOS.
	\item Interest in math (immediate application of basic trig in simple vector animations)
	\item Consider grabbing some source code from this time. The old //c still worked a couple of years ago. Perhaps these ancient floppys can still be read.
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{College 1988-1993}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculus - wow
	\item Diff-eq - wow squared
	\item Discrete Math - useful, but engineering classes focused almost exclusively on calc. I wish now I had 
	learned more in this area...it's never too late!
	\item Digital Design - wow - Bring on the flip-flops! (love those JK state machines)
	\item Operating Systems - neat
	\item Programming - Everything should be written in C (or so I naively thought at the time)
	\item IBM 370 Assembly - how about general purpose registers ready to do your bidding!
	\item Senior project - what was it again?
	\item Fortran - mention TAMUG summer school cruise. Old IBM desktops secured to tables due to rolling ship
	\end{itemize}

\section{Electronics Industry Co-op Job 1991-1992}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item TI ASIC division
	\item Mainframe
	\item Apollo workstations
	\item X-Windows
	\item Bourne shell
	\item the getopt() aha moment
	\end{itemize}
	
\section{Military Telecom Industry - First "Real" Job October 1993}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Living on brother's couch in Houston for a couple of months before finding employment
	\item PDP 11 - ICC Console
	\item TC C31 DSP
	\item Morotolla 68K
	\item VX-Works
	\item FPGA - xilinx
	\item ROM Burning
	\item ROM emulators
	\item Sync comm RS-422
	\item Switch architecture Interesting attributes: DUART multidrop mode, storing .o files in DB and linking at runtime
	\end{itemize}

\section{Commercial Telecom Industry 1995 - 2006}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The telecom boondoogle
	\item C, C++, more C++, then Java, with a smattering of SQL
	\item OO/UML
	\item All encompassing platform attempt
	\item Phoenix project, networking, networking, then PNet, it's all about async IO stupid
	\item CORBA vs DCOM
	\item IQTalk - smalltalk inspiration
	\item The rise of XML (if it has angle brackets, it's got to be good!)
	\item Any code samples from this period?
	\end{itemize}
