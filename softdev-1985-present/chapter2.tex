\section{College 1988-1993}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculus - wow
	\item Diff-Eq - wow squared
	\item Discrete Math - useful, but engineering classes focused almost exclusively on calc. I wish now I had 
	learned more in this area...it's never too late!
	\item Digital Design - wow - Bring on the flip-flops! (love those JK state machines)
	\item Operating Systems - neat
	\item Programming - Everything should be written in C (or so I naively thought at the time)
	\item IBM 370 Assembly - general purpose registers ready to do your bidding!
	\item Senior project - what was it again?
	\item Fortran - mention TAMUG summer school cruise. Old IBM desktops secured to tables due to rolling ship
	\end{itemize}
