\section{Introduction}
I have been involved in software development for most of my life. I do
not however, possess any great insight or wisdom. I have simply worked
in several industries and experienced first-hand many different
technologies and development techniques along the way. This is an
effort to catalog my experiences, thoughts, emotions, and ideas.

This is an experiment, which serves several selfish purposes. First, I
would like to document the evolution of my thoughts and
\emph{feelings} regarding the creation of software. Second, my writing
skills need attention, and therefore I must practice. This is not a technical
treatise, however technical details will be mentioned frequently.
