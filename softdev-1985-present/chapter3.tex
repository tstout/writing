\section{First "Real" Job October 1993}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Living on brother's couch in Houston for a couple of
          months before finding employment
\include{hard-to-find-bugs-part-1}
	\item PDP 11 - ICC Console
	\item TI C31 DSP
	\item Motorolla 68K
	\item VX-Works
	\item FPGA - xilinx
	\item ROM Burning
	\item ROM emulators
	\item Sync comm RS-422
	\item Tektronix logic probe
	\item Switch architecture Interesting attributes: DUART
          multidrop mode, storing .o files in DB and linking at
          runtime
          \item In Retrospect, the code was very clean compared
            to commercial endeavours. Reflect on why that seems hard
            to achieve these days in the commercial sector.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Commercial Telecom Industry 1995 - 2006}
	Rough Outline
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The telecom boondoogle
	\item C, C++, more C++, then Java, with a smattering of SQL
	\item OO/UML (Why do good pictures almost never precipitate
          good code?)
        \item OO Databases
	\item All encompassing platform attempt
	\item Phoenix project, networking, networking, then PNet, it's all about async IO stupid
	\item CORBA vs DCOM
	\item IQTalk - smalltalk inspiration
	\item The rise of XML (if it has angle brackets, it must be good!)
	\item Any code samples from this period? 
          I'm afraid not...damn I wish I had saved some for posterity.
	\end{itemize}
